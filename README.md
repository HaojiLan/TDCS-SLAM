# TDCS-SLAM

### V1.0, August 18th, 2023
**Authors:** Haoji Lan, Zhijun Zhang, Haotian He, and Yamei Luo.

TDCS-SLAM is  an efficient monocular visual-inertial SLAM method with two-stage descriptors computation strategy to obtain quick pose estimation of robot.

This system is based on [ORB-SLAM3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3).


# 1. License

TDCS-SLAM  is released under [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/HaojiLan/TDCS-SLAM/LICENSE).

# 2. Prerequisites
We have tested TDCS-SLAM in laptop with AMD Ryzen 7 6800H CPU, at 3.2 GHz, **Ubuntu 18.04**. 

## C++11 or C++0x Compiler
We use the new thread and chrono functionalities of C++11.

## Pangolin
We use [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) for visualization and user interface. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.

## OpenCV
We use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. **Required at leat 3.0. Tested with OpenCV 3.2.0 and 4.4.0**.

## Eigen3
Required by g2o (see below). Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Required at least 3.1.0**.

## DBoW2 and g2o (Included in Thirdparty folder)
We use modified versions of the [DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2) library to perform place recognition and [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library to perform non-linear optimizations. Both modified libraries (which are BSD) are included in the *Thirdparty* folder.


# 3. Building ORB-SLAM3 library and examples

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3.git ORB_SLAM3
```

We provide a script `build.sh` to build the *Thirdparty* libraries and *ORB-SLAM3*. Please make sure you have installed all required dependencies (see section 2). Execute:
```
cd ORB_SLAM3
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```


# 5. Examples
[EuRoC dataset](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) was recorded with two pinhole cameras and an inertial sensor. We provide an example script to launch EuRoC sequences in all the sensor configurations.

1. Download a sequence (ASL format) from http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets

2. Open the script "euroc_examples.sh" in the root of the project. Change **pathDatasetEuroc** variable to point to the directory where the dataset has been uncompressed. 

3. Execute the following script to process all the sequences with all sensor configurations:
```
./euroc_examples
```
##  TUM-VI Examples
[TUM-VI dataset](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/visual-inertial-dataset) was recorded with two fisheye cameras and an inertial sensor.

1. Download a sequence from https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/visual-inertial-dataset and uncompress it.

2. Open the script "tum_vi_examples.sh" in the root of the project. Change **pathDatasetTUM_VI** variable to point to the directory where the dataset has been uncompressed. 

3. Execute the following script to process all the sequences with all sensor configurations:
```
./tum_vi_examples
```
# 6. Evaluation

## Efficiency Evaluation
EuRoC provides ground truth for each sequence in the IMU body reference. As pure visual executions report trajectories centered in the left camera, we provide in the "evaluation" folder the transformation of the ground truth to the left camera reference. Visual-inertial trajectories use the ground truth from the dataset.

Execute the following script to process sequences and compute the RMS ATE:
```
./euroc_eval_examples
```


```

## Accuracy Evaluation
In TUM-VI ground truth is only available in the room where all sequences start and end. As a result the error measures the drift at the end of the sequence. 

Execute the following script to process sequences and compute the RMS ATE:
```
./tum_vi_eval_examples
```
  ```

# 8. Running time analysis
A flag in `include\Config.h` activates time measurements. It is necessary to uncomment the line `#define REGISTER_TIMES` to obtain the time stats of one execution which is shown at the terminal and stored in a text file(`ExecTimeMean.txt`).
